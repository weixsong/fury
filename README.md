some algorithm related projects collection

This repository is a collect of algorithm related projects. 

# AlgorithmPU
AlgorithmPU is the homework of algorithm class of Princeton University.
I just want to use git to record the change of each algorithm update, make it easy to roll back to correct code.

# MachineLearning
MachineLearning is the homework of Machine Learning class of Stanford University by Andrew Ng.
This is my second time to learn ML, and I just wan to use github to manage the homework code.
